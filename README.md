## Introduction
Hello my JBlock neighbours, its bunnyburger with gradient chat as GUI due to popular request.<br/>
I originally made it for myself as a goofy cool thing but others wanted it too so I made it so it has a GUI.<br/>

Here is an example of it in action<br/>

## How to run
* [Download the latest build on the Release Page](https://github.com/bunnyburger0498/css-gradient-chat/releases)<br/>
* Alternatively, You can download these scripts here and v1 AutoHotKey from the official site and run it via AHK.<br/>
AutoHotKey v2 is not compatible, so make sure to download v1 if you want to use the AHK method.<br/>
If you have experience with writing AHK stuff, feel free to edit code as you wish.<br/>
## Simple Colour Picker
